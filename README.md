Hi, this project displays a way of making an angularJS component working in an angular12 app with the upgrade module from angular.

to run the app:

install git and angular, open a terminal

git checkout https://github.com/YannisNaidja/angularjs-inside-angular.git 

cd angular-js-inside-angular

ng serve --o to run the app

The angularJS component is angularGantt: https://www.angular-gantt.com/ https://github.com/angular-gantt/angular-gantt
